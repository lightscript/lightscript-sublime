lightscript-sublime
-------------------

First release of LightScript syntax highlighting. 

Hacky and probably incomplete.

Since this is a fork, and Sublime Package Control uses git tags for versioning, a version bump of 100 is being used to ensure LightScript is ahead of previous Babel versions.
